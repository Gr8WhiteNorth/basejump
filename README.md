# Basejump WordPress theme

## Introduction

Some people swear by frameworks, some of us work best with grids and yet others prefer to build child themes off the WordPress default theme(s).

Having worked with all of the above, they have one thing in common: there's always something.

* A framework tends to try to cover all its bases and is therefore by default adding way too much "fluff" to the equation.
* When developing based on a grid - whether it's 12 columns, 16 columns, the golden ratio or whatever - there comes a point that a design is just that bit different and you will need to introduce all kinds of div's and/or classes to make the design fit the grid.
* Child themes are nice most of the times, but you need to rewrite a lot of functions or you're stuck with code that never gets used; in other words you'll end up with unnecessary overhead. 

That has been the main reason for me to develop this Basejump WordPress theme.

With the name I have tried to already suggest what it is. Take this theme and "jump off a cliff" (not literally of course) to make it into the site you want it to become.

## Features

Although the Basejump WordPress theme is a base theme for you to build upon, it still comes packed with quite a few features and I have coded it for WordPress 3.4 and above.

* Six different Page Templates, neatly organized in their own Page Templates directory (WordPress 3.4 feature); in alphabetical order:
** Alt Content Sidebar
** Alt Sidebar Content
** Content Sidebar
** Content Sidebar Alt
** Full Width
** Sidebar Content
* Upto six columns (best used on the one column Page Template)
* WPML ready and when activated it shows the language menu right in the menu bar navigation

## Installation



## Disclaimer

The Basejump WordPress theme runs on WordPress version 3.4 and above and I offer no backward compatibility.
